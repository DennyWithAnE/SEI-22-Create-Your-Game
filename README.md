Feel free to give me comments on where which code I should be changing or implementing new functions!



PROJECT 1 - PLANNING   General Idea - Fish burger or Cheeseburger ?  
It’s 2008, instead of the future we are “Back to the Past”!  
Here’s us being transported to a “Burger Bar” thrown with the responsibilities  of delivering the right orders for the customers!

“Build the burgers according to the customer’s order within the time given!”

“No time to explain why we are here!”  
Firstly user get to the page where they can input their name before they start.
After they clicked the link it will bring them to a new page where users will get to see the instructions with a “Start Game” button below it.

User will build the order similarly like the tic-tac-toe logic where the users will try to match the randomise order, I thought of using a while loop for this portion where the game will keep spewing orders while the timer != 0   This is the basic functionality of my game!
